## Description
This project required us to code an application that would automatically write some readme content based on prompted answers using npm inquirer and node JS, and then create a readme file within a specified directory using the fs writeFile method available in nodeJS. Motivation for this assignment was to learn more about node js, inqirer, and concepts such as promises that I had not had much exposure too up until this point in our course. 

A demonstration of the application and its functionality can be seen below ( I specified my destination for the readme files to be within a test folder so that I would not overwrite my actual readme here as I continued to explore and test additional concepts with this same code after I had it fully working to satisfy our assignment acceptance criteria. ) A screenshot illustrating the command line inputs, the readme file and how it formats is also provided.

## Usage
This application can be used to quickly generate a formatted readme for your repo. By running the application from the terminal you can enter prompted answers to questions, and have the answers written into a formatted readme that includes a table of contents and a title / headings. See the recorded demo in the description section for more info. 

## Installation
To install this application you just need to ensure that you have nodeJS and run the npm i command to get required dependencies, such as inquirer.
